NAME
    Text::AutoLink - Automatically Linkfy

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::AutoLink;
      my $auto = Text::AutoLink->new;
      my $text = $auto->parse_string('http://search.cpan.org');
      # '<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>'

      my $auto = Text::AutoLink->new(
        plugins => [
            'Text::AutoLink::Plugin::HTTP'
            Text::AutoLink::Plugin::FTP->new(%args)
        ]
      );

DESCRIPTION
    Text::AutoLink is a module inspired by Text::Hatena. I just wanted to
    automatically make HTML links in arbitrary text that is not in
    Text::Hatena format, so here it is.

    Text::AutoLink is designed such that it can handle plain text or HTML
    text, with the focus on allowing arbitrary plugins to handle the
    transformation.

METHODS
  new(%args)
    Creates a new Text::AutoLink object.

    plugins ARRAYREF
        You may specify the list of plugins that you want to apply on a
        text. If you don't specify this parameter, Text::AutoLink will
        include all the plugins that are available under
        Text::AutoLink::Plugin namespace.

  plugins
    Returns the list of plugins that are associated with this instance.

  parse_string SCALAR
    Parses the given string and auto-links strings that are not already
    linked. Returns the modified string.

  parse_file SCALAR
    Parses the given file.

  parse_fh FILEHANDLE
    Parses the given file handle.

CAVEATS
    This is alpha quality release. Proceed at your own peril. Patches, ideas
    welcome.

    Text::AutoLink internally uses HTML::TreeBuilder, so the resulting text
    may slightly be different from the input. In my experience this is
    usually not a problem, but if you are being strict it may bite you.
